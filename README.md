# Internet-Relay-Chat-Room-Project
Nowadays, online chatting room is super common. The document describes a simple version of chatting platform, which can be accessed by multiple user in multiple rooms. The main goal of this project is gaining more hand-on experience on networking protocol application and being more familiar with internet connection.
This system employs a central server which ''relays'' messages that are sent to it to other connected users. Users can join rooms, which are groups of users that are subscribed to the same message stream. Any message sent to that room is forwarded to all users currently joined to that room. User can list all the members in the room and all the rooms current existence. Users can also send private messages directly to other users or join multiple rooms at the same time.
